Methodology
1.	Download reference genome in FASTA format assembled genome of Escherichia coli.
```
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR228/040/SRR22895640/SRR22895640_1.fastq.gz
```
2.	Download the reads (forward and reverse) for using them against the reference genome. They should be in FASTQ format.
3.	Run indexing of reference genome using bowtie2 tool.
4.	Use bowtie2 to assemble the reads.
5.	Run samtools package to create the bam file and sort the file as well.
6.	Then run bcftools for variant calling (creating vcf file with all variants listed with reference to the reference genome)
